				<h4>Mercury</h4>
				<p>
					The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than
					Earth's Moon.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when
					viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity
					to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby
					Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise
					briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in
					reverse at sunset.
				</p>
			</div>

		<section id="2" class="base-flex fright">
			<img src="./Spacedive_files/Venus.png" id="venus" alt="Venus">
			<div>
				<h4>Venus</h4>
				<p>
					Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary
					neighbor. It's one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets,
					and
					it's often called Earth's twin because it's similar in size and density.
					These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences
					between the two worlds.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and
					it's perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid
					that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It's the hottest
					planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.
					Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475
					degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color
					and it's peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of
					large volcanoes. Scientists think it's possible some volcanoes are still
					active.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Another big difference from Earth – Venus rotates on its axis
					backward, compared to most of the other planets in the solar system.
					This
					means that, on Venus, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east,
					opposite to what we experience on Earth. (It's not the only planet in
					our
					solar system with such an oddball rotation – Uranus spins on its side.)

					<h4>Earth</h4>
					<p>
						Earth is the third planet from the Sun and home to all
						known life. While large volumes of water can be found throughout the
						Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. Approximately
						70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar
						ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land,
						consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of
						several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce
						mountain
						ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The atmosphere of Earth consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen.
						Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide trap a part of
						the
						energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor is widely present
						in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. More
						solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is
						redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. A region's climate
						is
						governed not only by latitude but also by elevation and proximity to
						moderating oceans.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is
						the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is
						the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away
						from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to
						complete
						one revolution. The Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less
						than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes).

			<div class="base-flex moon">
				<img id="moon" src="./Spacedive_files/Moon_Earth.png" alt="Moon">

				<div>
					<h5>Moon</h5>
					<p>
						The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth
						largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive
						relative to its parent planet, with a diameter about one-quarter that of
						Earth (comparable to the width of Australia). The Moon is a
						planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a
						satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term and
						larger
						than all known dwarf planets of the Solar System. It lacks any
						significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km, or about 30 times Earth's diameter. Its gravitational influence is
						the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens Earth's day.
						The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During
						each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface
						illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar
						phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon
						is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full
						rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near
						side)
						to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as
						the synodic period.

					<h4>Mars</h4>
					<p>
						Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold,
						desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet
						with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence
						that it was even more active in the past.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and
						it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien
						landscape.An international fleet of eight orbiters is studying the Red
						Planet from above including three NASA orbiters: 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars
						Reconnaissance Orbiter, and MAVEN.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one
						lander (InSight), and one helicopter (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of
						Mars.Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent
						to another world – touched down on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day
						journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers). The
						Ingenuity helicopter rode to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance.
						Perseverance is one of three spacecraft that arrived at Mars in 2021. The
						Hope orbiter from the United Arab Emirates arrived on Feb. 9, 2021.
						China's Tianwen-1 mission arrived on Feb. 10, 2021, and includes an
						orbiter, a lander, and a rover. Europe and India also have spacecraft
						studying Mars from orbit.

					<h5>Phobos and Deimos</h5>
					<p>
						The two moons of Mars are Phobos and Deimos.
						They are irregular in shape. Both were discovered by American astronomer
						Asaph Hall in August 1877 and are named after the Greek mythological
						twin
						characters Phobos (fear and panic) and Deimos (terror and dread) who
						accompanied their father Ares into battle. Ares, god of war, was known
						to
						the Romans as Mars.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Compared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small.
						Phobos has a diameter of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) and a mass of 1.08*1016 kg,
						while Deimos measures 12.6 km (7.8 mi) across, with a mass of 2.0*1015
						kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377 km
						(5,827 mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits
						farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460 km (14,580 mi) and an orbital
						period of 30.35 hours.

				<img id="jupiter" src="./Spacedive_files/Jupiter.png" alt="Jupiter">
				<div>
					<h4>Jupiter</h4>
					<p>
						Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
						System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times
						that
						of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, while being
						slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the
						third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon
						and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was
						named
						after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, followed by helium which
						constitutes a
						quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction
						of
						Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the
						Sun. Because of its rapid rotation at a rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours,
						the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid, having a slight but noticeable
						bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series
						of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting
						boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant
						storm which has been observed since at least 1831.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a
						powerful
						magnetosphere. The planet's magnetic tail is nearly 800 million
						kilometres (5.3 astronomical units; 500 million miles) long. Jupiter has
						92 known moons and likely many more, including the four large moons
						discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and
						Callisto. Ganymede is the largest out of the four, being larger than the
						planet Mercury, followed by Callisto with Io and Europa being
						approximately the size of Earth's moon.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="base-flex satellite">
				<div>
					<h5>Ganymede and Io</h5>
					<p>
						Jupiter's icy moon Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar system,
						even bigger than the planet Mercury, and the dwarf
						planet Pluto. There's strong evidence that Ganymede has an underground
						saltwater ocean that may hold more water than all the water on Earth's
						surface. It might even have ice and oceans stacked up in several layers
						like a club sandwich.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Ganymede is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field –
						something typically found on planets like
						Earth. The magnetic field causes auroras, or bright ribbons of glowing
						gas, that circle the moon's poles.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Io, or Jupiter I, is the innermost and third-largest of the four
						Galilean moons of the planet
						Jupiter. Slightly larger than Luna, Io is the fourth-largest moon in
						the
						Solar System, has the highest density of any moon, the strongest
						surface
						gravity of any moon, and the lowest amount of water (by atomic ratio)
						of
						any known astronomical object in the Solar System. It was discovered in
						1610 by Galileo Galilei and was named after the mythological character
						Io, a priestess of Hera who became one of Zeus's lovers.

				<div>
					<h4>Saturn</h4>
					<p>
						Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the
						second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant
						with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It
						has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times
						more massive.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a rocky core,
						surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer
						of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer
						layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its
						upper
						atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is
						thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is
						weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of
						Earth due to Saturn's larger size.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The planet's most notable feature is its prominent ring system,
						which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of
						rocky debris and dust. At least 83 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of
						which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of
						moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second
						largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the
						planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a
						substantial atmosphere.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="base-flex satellite">
				<div>
					<h5>Titan and Enceladus</h5>
					<p>
						Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the
						second-largest natural satellite in the Solar System. It is the only
						moon known to have a dense atmosphere, and is the only known object in
						space other than Earth on which clear evidence of stable bodies of
						surface liquid has been found.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Titan is one of the seven gravitationally rounded moons in orbit
						around Saturn, and the second most distant from Saturn of those seven.
						Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger (in
						diameter) than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the
						second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Ganymede,
						and is larger than the planet Mercury, but only 40% as massive.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn (19th largest in the
						Solar System). It is about 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter,
						about
						a tenth of that of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Enceladus is mostly
						covered by fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective
						bodies
						of the Solar System. Consequently, far colder than a light-absorbing
						body would be.

				<div>
					<h4>Uranus</h4>
					<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is named after Greek
						sky deity Uranus (Caelus), who in Greek mythology is the father of
						Cronus (Saturn), a grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and great-grandfather
						of Ares (Mars). Uranus has the third-largest planetary radius and
						fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. The planet is
						similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical
						compositions which differ from those of the other two giant planets,
						Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants). For this reason, scientists often
						distinguish Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants".</p>
					<br>
					<p>As with gas giants, ice giants lack a well-defined solid surface.
						Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary
						composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as
						water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.
						It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System. It has a complex,
						layered cloud structure; water is thought to make up the lowest clouds
						and methane the uppermost layer. The planet's interior is mainly
						composed of ices and rock.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a
						magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique
						configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly
						into the plane of its solar orbit. Therefore, its north and south poles
						lie where most other planets have their equators. In 1986, images from
						Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible
						light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other
						giant planets. No other spacecraft have yet visited the planet.
						Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased
						weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="base-flex satellite">

					<h5>Titania and Oberon</h5>
					<p>
						Titania, also designated Uranus III, is the
						largest of the moons of Uranus and the eighth largest moon in the Solar
						System at a diameter of 1,578 kilometres (981 mi). Discovered by
						William
						Herschel in 1787, it is named after the queen of the fairies in
						Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies inside Uranus's
						magnetosphere.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The Uranian system has been studied up close only once, by the
						spacecraft Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of
						Titania,
						which allowed mapping of about 40% of its surface.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Oberon, also designated Uranus IV, is the outermost
						major moon of the planet Uranus. It is the second-largest and second
						most massive of the Uranian moons, and the ninth most massive moon in
						the Solar System. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is
						named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character
						in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies partially
						outside Uranus's magnetosphere.
					</p>
					<br>

					<h4>Neptune</h4>
					<p>
						Neptune is the eighth and furthest planet in the Solar System from
                        the Sun. It was discovered in 1846 on the basis of mathematical
                        calculations and predictions of a backward impact on the orbit of
                        Uranus. Neptune was named after the ancient Roman god of the seas.
                        This gas giant planet is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium and
                        traces of methane, which gives it its bright blue coloring.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Methane clouds in the upper atmosphere reflect sunlight, which
                        creates a bright blue hue on the visible side of the planet.
                        Violent atmospheric phenomena such as vortices and storms are
                        characteristic of Neptune, making it one of the most dynamic
                        objects in the Solar System.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Neptune has icy clouds and strong winds reaching over 2000 kilometres
                        per hour. These winds create powerful violent storms, including the
                        famous "Great Dark Spot" that was spotted by Russell Hertz in 1989.
                        Studying the extreme conditions on Neptune is helping to expand our
                        understanding of planetary physics and astronomy.

					<h5>Triton and Proteus</h5>
					<p>
						Triton is the largest natural satellite of
						the planet Neptune, and was the first Neptunian moon to be discovered,
						on October 10, 1846, by English astronomer William Lassell. It is the
						only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, an orbit
						in
						the direction opposite to its planet's rotation. Because of its
						retrograde orbit and composition similar to Pluto, Triton is thought to
						have been a dwarf planet, captured from the Kuiper belt.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						During its 1989 flyby of Triton, Voyager 2 found surface
						temperatures of 38 K (-235 °C) and also discovered active geysers
						erupting sublimated nitrogen gas, contributing to a tenuous nitrogen
						atmosphere less than 1/70,000 the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea
						level. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Triton. As
						the probe was only able to study about 40% of the moon's surface,
						future
						missions (Dubbed "Trident") have been proposed to Nasa via their
						Discovery Program to revisit the Neptune system with a focus on Triton.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Proteus, also known as Neptune VIII, is the second-largest
						Neptunian moon, and Neptune's largest inner satellite. Discovered by
						Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, it is named after Proteus, the
						shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology. Proteus orbits Neptune in a
						nearly equatorial orbit at a distance of about 4.75 times the radius of
						Neptune's equator.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Proteus is probably not an original body that formed with Neptune.
						It could have accreted later from the debris formed when the largest
						Neptunian satellite Triton was captured.
